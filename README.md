### Intermediate Programming - Project 3 ###

#### About ####

The third project for Intermediate Programming involves the writing of a GUI-driven program meant to calculate the terms of a sequence of numbers, namely: 0 1 2 5 12 29, wherein each term in the sequence is equal to twice the previous term plus the second previous term. The program provides the user with the opportunity to employ a recursive or iterative means by which the desired term is acquired, and provides a data file upon program closing that displays the efficiency of both types of answer acquisition.
